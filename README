# AccountIt

**AccountIt** *(working title)* is something of an experiment for me to create a workable accounting solution as a freelancer with a focus on tracking expenses for a given job or project, whilst maintaining the functionality of a reasonable double-entry accouting solution.

There is by no means any guarantee that the code provided here (and any derivatives - software, etc.) will be useful, or even usable for a given purpose – though, if it is, feel free to do with it as you wish.

Don't sell it though. That'd be a bit unfair.
